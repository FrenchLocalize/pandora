	<entry name="AcceptSanctionsAgainstThirdParty0" value="&quot;Sanctions are better than war. Who should we isolate?&quot;"/>
	<entry name="RejectSanctionsAgainstThirdParty0" value="&quot;I think sanctions are a step too far. We need more evidence, sorry.&quot;"/>

	<entry name="DemandPeaceOfferToThirdParty0" value="&quot;Old pal. I know you love war--war, but how about trying a bit of jaw--jaw, hmm?&quot;"/> 
	<entry name="AcceptPeaceOfferToThirdParty0" value="&quot;Excellent idea. We'll get a summit arranged immediately.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="RejectPeaceOfferToThirdParty0" value="&quot;I'm sorry, the council isn't sitting today. Could you call back tomorrow?&quot;"/>

	<!-- Demands from dialogue partner to declare war to a third faction. -->
	<entry name="DemandWarDeclarationOnThirdParty0" value="&quot;It would be absolutely appalling if you ended up at war, despite what they've been saying. Oh, you haven't heard...? Oh, my.&quot;"/> 
	<entry name="AcceptWarDeclarationOnThirdParty0" value="&quot;I'm intrigued to hear how we could possibly be at war...&quot;"/>
	<entry name="RejectWarDeclarationOnThirdParty0" value="&quot;At war? The Ambassadors? We'd have to change our name!&quot;"/>

	<entry name="RejectShareMap" value="&quot;I'm afraid our maps are mainly of relationships, not territory, so they'd be of no use to you.&quot;"/>
	
	<!-- Offers dialogue partner the right to travel through each others controlled territories. -->
	<entry name="OfferOpenBorders" value="&quot;Did you ever hear of Schengen? Wasn't that a wonderful experiment? Freedom of movement benefits us all.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="AcceptOpenBorders" value="&quot;Look, we'll issue temporary work permits to all your citizens. And if soldiers happen to walk through our land on their way somewhere else... plausible deniability, my friend.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="RejectOpenBorders" value="&quot;Of course! You just need to fill out this paperwork, have it stamped correctly and take it to Inspector Grestin at the department of bureaucracy.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="TerminateOpenBorders" value="&quot;Apparently, we've had some issues with an inspector at the border, just letting anyone through. We need to close it, to deal with the insurgents. I hope you understand, %1%?&quot;"/>
	<entry name="AcceptOpenBordersTerminated" value="&quot;Well, that's really sad. I mean, if we had any spies they could still waltz through it anyway. But we don't, of course.&quot;"/>

	<entry name="Denounce" value="&quot;%7%, there are diplomatic means to the same end.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="AcceptDenounce" value="&quot;Come now. This is no more than realpolitik. Did you ever read Il Principe? You should.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="RejectDenounce" value="&quot;That's not true. And if it was true, it wouldn't be wrong. And if it was wrong, you couldn't prove it.&quot;"/>

	<!-- Offers surrender. -->
	<entry name="OfferSurrender" value="&quot;We offer our surrender, our subjugation to your immutable will. We won't even demand a treaty! ...well, maybe a small one.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="AcceptSurrender" value="&quot;I knew that you'd eventually come around to our way of thinking.&quot;"/>
	<entry name="RejectSurrender" value="&quot;No. We prefer to keep our enemies close, and our friends at a distance. Sorry.&quot;"/>
	
	<!-- Compliments for this faction. -->
