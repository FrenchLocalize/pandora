	<entry name="Artillery0Description" value="Indirect firing requires remote target acquisition, usually in the form of a forward observer, but Pandora's unknown gravitational interferences have made accurate long range firing more of a chance-based endeavour and far from reliable.<br/><br/>Guided indirect firing disposes of the human forward observer in favor of a drone guider which can provide in-flight corrections to heavy ordnance projectiles for accurate bombardment."/>

	<entry name="Artillery1Description" value="Where common weapons only diminish the chances of a target escaping fire, the Gunther doesn't show any kind of mercy. Its high rate of fire, automated MRSI calculation and fragmentation air burst projectiles allow him to not only apply the principle upon a target, but upon a whole area several dozen meters wide."/>

	<entry name="Artillery2Description" value="The Cygnus brings another lethal component into the fray: gravitons. When the shells implode, the release of gravitons is sufficient to emulate the effect of a portable and non-lasting black hole, pulling objects in their vicinity toward the blast point and crushing them under the force of their gravitational field."/>

	<entry name="Automatic1Description" value="Studying thousands of gunfights, specifically combatants' movement patterns along with the random variables in projectile responses, has opened the door for a new generation of automatic weapons: next to their state of the art firepower they attempt to compensate for all uncertainties encountered on the battlefield. Stochastically adjusted flight curves considerably increase the weapon's average accuracy.<br/><br/><style oblique='1'/>Response in the troops is mixed: especially veteran soldiers are not too fond of guns that stray on purpose, no matter what &quot;theoretical nonsense&quot; might lurk behind."/>

	<entry name="Automatic2Description" value="The Deiphobus ammunition is specifically tailored to trigger a chain reaction breaking down cells to their core subatomic components. Most Deiphobus's victims probably won't care much for the exact process, as it amounts to a simple and almost instantaneous disintegration for them."/>

	<entry name="Cannon0Description" value="To break through the thick armor and hull of tanks, weapons of immense fire power are required. Cannons are mounted on heavy war machines and deliver a highly devastating payload that crushes through everything in its path.

Its AI-driven targeting system also grants it near-perfect accuracy, making the Tachyon Cannon the most frightening weapon in modern armies."/>

	<entry name="Flak2Description" value="Artifically creating sprite lightnings, the effects of the Mirage are quite a sight to behold - from a safe distance. Though not destructive in and of itself, the electrical discharge in the upper atmosphere jams weapons, disrupts electronic functions, causes bugs in all kinds of software, and has repercussions right down to the ground, though to a much lesser extent. A single shot from this type of flak has caused the loss of more than one heavy bomber."/>

	<entry name="Flame1Description" value="This evolution of the Hellfire brings its own twist to the battlegrounds: dual tanks hold respectively so-called magic acid and water, each of them coming out through a different barrel. The acid is propelled first, causing severe chemical burns to the target. Then comes the pressurized water, provoking the explosive reaction that gives the weapon its name."/>

In reality, what is propelled is a highly hazardous mix of various Pandorian toxins, much more active than their terran counterparts: exo-, neuro-, hemo-, photo-,  cardiotoxins and yet a few more. The victim is almost literally eaten alive, both form the inside and the outside."/>
