2	Installation
================================================================================

Please ensure your system meets the minimum requirements.

2.1	Windows
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install the game, either double click on the installation file you downloaded
or insert the Pandora DVD into your drive. If you have disabled the autorun
function on your drive or if you are installing from a digital download,
double-click on the installation archive file, then double click on the file
that is shown inside the archive. Follow all on-screen prompts to complete
installation.

Please use the Add/Remove Programs option from the Windows Control Panel or the
Uninstall shortcut in the games Windows START menu folder to uninstall the game.
Uninstalling through any other method will not properly uninstall the game.

2.2	Mac OS X
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Extract the distributed .zip file by double-clicking it and then double-click on
"Pandora.app" to start the game. When using Safari with newer versions of OS X
the .zip file may be automatically extracted. You may have to explicitly allow
Pandora to start by holding down the ctrl key and clicking on "Pandora.app" and
selecting "Open" or by going into "Apple menu > System Preferences... > Security
& Privacy > General tab" and under the header "Allow applications downloaded 
from:" selecting "Anywhere".

2.3	Linux
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Extract the distributed .zip file, browse inside the extracted
"Pandora/Binaries" directory and double-click (execute) "Pandora" to start the
game.

2.4	Updates and Patches
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pandora will automatically check for updates when started. If an update is
detected, you will be shown the changes for the update and have the option to
start the automated process of downloading and applying the update or to skip
the update and continue playing the currently installed version.

From time to time updates will be compiled into larger stand alone patch
installer files. These can be downloaded outside of the game and run on a
different machine so if your gaming PC does not have internet you can still
update. These patches will be less frequently released but if you have any
issues with the auto updater they are the backup plan to keep you updated.

3	User Data
================================================================================

User data such as saved games, screen shots, configuration and log files are 
stored in the following locations:

*	Windows Vista/7:
	"C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Roaming\Proxy Studios\Pandora\"

*	Windows XP:
	"C:\Documents and Settings\<user>\Application Data\Proxy Studios\Pandora\"

*	Mac OS X:
	"/Users/<user>/Library/Application Support/Proxy Studios/Pandora/"

*	Linux:
	"/home/<user>/.config/Proxy Studios/Pandora/"

4	Modding
================================================================================

The "Data/" directory in the installation directory is managed by the updater, 
do not modify it. Any added or modified files may be deleted or replaced.

For modifications create a "Data/" directory with the same structure in the user 
data directory outlined above. Files placed there will be loaded instead of 
their distributed equivalents.

5	Known Issues
================================================================================

5.1	Graphics Drivers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please make sure you have the latest graphics drivers installed if you are
experiencing issues with starting the game. This is particularly common on
laptops with outdated brand drivers.

5.2	Background Applications
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any applications running in the background may negatively affect Pandora. 
Certain applications can lead to more serious issues such as limited 
connectivity and game crashes. It is highly recommended that you close all 
background applications before launching Pandora to ensure the best performance 
and stability. After you are done playing, feel free to re-enable these 
applications.

Some applications may load when the operating system starts and are not 
obviously indicated. For example, they may not appear in the task bar but they
may be among some of your active processes or services, using your system's 
resources. These programs may cause crashes and other difficulties when playing 
Pandora.

5.3 Security Applications
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Antivirus and firewall software play an important role in your computer 
security. They help protect your computer from viruses, malware and spyware 
infections. However, when protecting your computer, they can prevent legitimate
programs, like Pandora, from installing, updating or running. Disabling or 
temporarily uninstalling your security software can help resolve these
conflicts.

Note: Some security programs will continue to partially run even when disabled.
They may require full uninstallation or reconfiguration to resolve.

If you are not comfortable configuring or uninstalling your security software, 
please contact your security software's technical support department for
assistance. They may also be able to help you configure their product to not
interfere with future game installation and patching.
