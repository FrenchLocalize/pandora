	<entry name="Tip0" value="Colonizers are massive construction units that allow you to build new cities which form the backbone of your empire. To found your first city on Pandora, click the &quot;Build City&quot; button in the selection panel to your left. Note that this order will consume your Colonizer."/>
	<entry name="Tip1" value="Colonial Troopers are your first line of defense against rival factions and hostile alien species. You can either play safe by fortifying the troopers in your city, or send them out on exploration duty by right clicking on your destination territory. Exploration is risky, but can be very rewarding!"/>
	<entry name="Tip2" value="You are currently in the city management view. A city can produce one item at a time (for example a unit or building), and on the upper left side you see your production options. By left clicking on an option it is added to the production queue and production will begin when the turn ends."/>
	<entry name="Tip3" value="The priorities panel helps you focus your colonists into specific areas. Feel free to experiment, you can see the reflected changes in the statistics panel just below. Being smart about priorities can be the difference between a flourishing empire and a miserable one."/>
	<entry name="Tip4" value="If you have enough credits available, you can invest them to speed up or quickly change production. However, you will want to be careful about changing your current production after it has started -- you will lose a portion of your acculumated production each turn you do so."/>
	<entry name="Tip5" value="On the upper right side you see a list of all buildings that have been produced in this city. To sell a building simple click on it."/>
	<entry name="Tip6" value="The native alien life forms of this world are a constant threat to your empire. There exist different species in different climates, and some of them are extremely dangerous. Make sure to protect your cities and Formers from any alien onslaught!"/>
	<entry name="Tip7" value="Units are built after designs, and the workshop allows you to manage and customize your designs by first choosing a class, followed by a compatible weapon and armor. Each module has their own strengths and weaknesses, and over the course of the game you will gain access to a plethora of new modules."/>
	<entry name="Tip8" value="Formers build terrain modifications like farms and mines, which improve the resource output of territories utilized by cities. For greater convenience you can automatize Formers by pressing the &quot;Automatize&quot; button in the selection panel."/>
	<entry name="Tip9" value="You are low on resources! Move your mouse over the resources on the top left of the screen to find out what is going on! Perhaps it would help to tweak your cities' priorities, produce a building or two, or establish a new city with a Colonizer."/>
	<entry name="Tip10" value="If you are unsure what to do next, refer to the task button on the right side of the screen. It will help you focus on the next task ahead before you proceed to end your turn."/>
